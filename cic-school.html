                <p>We wont pretend to be the judges on what makes great art, but we do know a little bit about marketing and design and we can tell you that what
                    does the best in our fundraisers are playful, buoyant pieces that reflect times and seasons. We encourage creative expression, but it shouldn't 
                    come at the expense of your sales! Our only no-no is glitter as it doesn't get along well with the scanning machines.
